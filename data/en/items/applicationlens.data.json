While you can continue optimizing certain elements of the application, after optimizing the initial 20%, a company typically sees a diminishing return on any further optimization. The question the customer must answer is how much of the remaining 80% of the application is worth optimizing for the business. In other words, how much will optimizing the remaining 80% help the business reach its goals (e.g. customer acquisition/retention, sales, etc.)? The business must determine their own realistic definition of &quot;acceptable.&quot;",
